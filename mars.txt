We have revised our projections for this file and are instead going to use it as a serious document in order to set the foundation for a future flight to Mars
Uh oh, it looks like we already have someone there on Mars ahead of us. How are we going to get funding now??
Oh damn we're screwed. No money. I'm without a car. Please save us NASA!!

NASA has given us a grant in order to STOP sending people to Mars.
